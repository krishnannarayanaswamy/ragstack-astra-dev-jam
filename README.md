# Welcome to DataStax - Gen AI Dev Jam


You are here because you are curious about simplifying your Gen AI journey. DataStax has the answer. 
DataStax is a real-time data company for building production Gen AI applications. Our vector search capability is
the key to harnessing the potential of generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for
your Gen AI applications. Think of it as a mix of Astra DB, our fully managed data service with vector
search capabilities, seamlessly integrated into the LangChain and Cassio app developer framework.
This unique cocktail is loved by developers because it provides the means to rapidly master Gen AI and
RAG, enabling the creation of powerful, contextually rich systems.
