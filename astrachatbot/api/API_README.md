## API Readme

# Setup

This readme is for a FastAPI api that uses pydantic to parse incoming data. That data is used to retreive documents from an Astra vector store and then both the original query and the user input are used to construct a prompt. That prompt is sent to OpenAI and the api returns the response to the user.

Then clone this repo and install the Python requirements (This demo assumes you already have python3 installed):
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Input all of you authentication credentials into utils/local_creds.py. This file requries your Astra app token, database id, and region. It also needs the keyspace name and collection name for your vector store. Lastly it requries your OpenAI api key.

# Start Process

To run the api enter the command:
```
uvicorn api.index:app --reload
```
